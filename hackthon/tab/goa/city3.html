                <p>Majestic is the word that best defines Fort Aguada, one of the famous forts in Goa. The imposing fort enjoys a strategic location even as the waves of the Arabian Sea play along its lofty walls. Steeped in history, this colossal fort dates back to the 17th century and offers a spectacular view of the sea that spreads in front of it. Among the main attractions of the fort are a series of prison cells and an ancient lighthouse, which is the oldest one of its kind in Asia.</p>
